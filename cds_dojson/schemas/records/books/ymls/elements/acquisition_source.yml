      Possible values are:
      `submitter`
          when obtained from a user submission. In this case, `orcid`,
          `internal_uid` and `email` store identifiers of the submitter,
          and `submission_number` an ID of the submission. The submitter can be the cataloger.
      `oai`
          when obtained by OAI-PMH harvesting.
      `batchuploader`
          when obtained through the batch uploader.
      `hepcrawl`
          when obtained from a hepcrawl crawler. In this case, `source`
          stores the publisher or the repository that was crawled.
