            ``book``
                Published Monograph (usually has an ISBN and a publisher)
            ``proceedings``

                The :ref:`conference_info` field contains the information of the conference.
                If published in a journal, :ref:`publication_info` also contains the journal information.
            ``report``

                A thesis. The :ref:`thesis_info` field contains additional
