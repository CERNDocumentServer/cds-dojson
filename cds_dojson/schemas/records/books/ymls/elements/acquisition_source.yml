    Only the first source is stored: if the record later gets enriched with
    metadata coming from a second source, the `acquisition_source` is not
    updated.

            This does not necessarily coincide with the creation date of the
            record, as there might be some delay between the moment the
            original information is obtained and a record is finally created in
            the system.

            Possible values are:
            `submitter`
                when obtained from a user submission. In this case, `orcid`,
                `internal_uid` and `email` store identifiers of the submitter,
                and `submission_number` an ID of the submission. The submitter can be the cataloger.
            `oai`
                when obtained by OAI-PMH harvesting.
            `batchuploader`
                when obtained through the batch uploader.
            `hepcrawl`
                when obtained from a hepcrawl crawler. In this case, `source`
                stores the publisher or the repository that was crawled.
