      Because of technical limitations, for some older records the
      affiliations were associated globally to the record instead of its
      individual authors (using the
      :ref:`authors/items/properties/affiliations` field).

      There can be several because the preprint title often differs from
      the published version. The title should be kept as on the document
      and in the same language as the document (see :ref:`languages`).
      Translations go into :ref:`title_translations`.
