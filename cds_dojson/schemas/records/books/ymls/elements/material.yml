    The possible values are:
    ``addendum``
        for a document extending the main publication.
    ``additional material``
        for additional material attached to the main publication, that is
        neither the more specific ``data`` or ``software``.
    ``data``
        for data related to the main publication.
    ``erratum``
        for a document correcting errors in the content of the main
        publication. When the errors are not in the content but in the
        publication process, it is considered as an ``editorial note`` instead.
    ``editorial note``
        for a document correcting errors in the metadata of the publication but
        not its content. Otherwise, it is an ``erratum``.
    ``preprint``
        for a document that is made public (typically on `arXiv
        <http://arxiv.org>`_) but not yet published formally.
    ``publication``
        for the main publication. If it's not published, it's a ``preprint``.
    ``reprint``
        for a reprint of the main publication.
    ``software``
        for software related to the main publication.
    ``translation``
